/**
 * This interface represents the strategy used to match scope. Some of these
 * strategies may be:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>NONE: no scope will match</li>
 *     <li>ALL: all scope will match</li>
 *     <li>STRICT: only scope matching a particular string or strings
 *     will match</li>
 *     <li>HIERARCHICAL: scope following some naming rules might match more
 *     general scope. For instance using <i>dot notation</i> we can code that
 *     shorter scope that share a common prefix, for example
 *     <i>everything</i> imply longer scope such as <i>everything.readonly</i>.
 *    </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * ScopeMatcher might also be combined with {@link PrefixHandler} and
 * {@link ScopeMapper} to tailor the matching strategy to the framework
 * configuration.
