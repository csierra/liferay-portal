algorithm=Algorithm (Automatic Copy)
algorithm-description=Algorithm of the digits of the Time-Based One Time Password (Automatic Copy)
algorithm-key-size=Algorithm Key Size (Automatic Copy)
algorithm-key-size-description=Set the size of the Key Algorithm (Automatic Copy)
clock-skew=Clock Skew (Automatic Copy)
clock-skew-description=Because of possible drifts between the clock of the device that generates the Time-Based One Time Password and the clock of the validation server, this is the time in milliseconds that the clocks can differ before a code will be rejected. This would mean the validator could perform a validation against the current time and then two further validations (+ clock skew time / - clock skew time). (Automatic Copy)
